The dataset consists of 31464 images and is divided into 7 tensors with each tensor consists of 5000 images except the last one CONSISTS OF 1464 images and the labels are in sequential format.
This is so that I could run this on kaggle free version without disrupting my training process as no ram in free tier, The tensor5k will consist of images from 0 to 5k and tensor10k will consist of images from 5k to 10k and so on the labels are in same format
The images are taken from HDA Facesynthesis and only indian images are taken in this training process as the project we are doing aims to find lost children across india so there will be bias in the training process.
